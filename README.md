# Hydrogeological-Analysis-of-Streamflow-and-Baseflow-in-Ontario-and-British-Columbia
This project focuses on a comprehensive hydrogeological investigation of 20 strategically selected stream gauge stations across Ontario and British Columbia. The primary objectives include ensuring a minimum of 15 years of available data, each with at least 320 days in a year, and utilizing the USGS tool (WHAT) to calculate baseflow hydrographs. A digital filter with a parameter of 0.925 will be applied for baseflow calculations. The results will be utilized to plot streamflow hydrographs, calculate long-term baseflow indices, and create a geographical map showcasing the spatial pattern of baseflow indices for all 20 stations. Through the analysis, we aim to unravel the physio-climatic factors influencing the spatial distribution of baseflow, such as temperature, snow, rain, elevation, and geology. The final report will encompass station details, hydrographs, baseflow indices, a spatial map, and discussions on the observed patterns and controlling factors.
